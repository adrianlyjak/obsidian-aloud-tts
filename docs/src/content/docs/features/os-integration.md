description: Using Aloud TTS with your operating system's media controls.
---

Aloud TTS integrates with your operating system's media controls, allowing you to manage playback without needing to have Obsidian in focus. This is especially useful for listening to long notes while working in other applications or on mobile devices.

## Desktop Integration

On desktop operating systems like macOS and Windows, the currently playing audio will appear in your system's media controls. For example, on macOS, you'll see the player in the Control Center and as a notification. You can use these native controls to:

-   Play or pause the audio.
-   See the title of the note being read.

## Mobile Integration

On mobile devices (iOS and Android), Aloud TTS behaves like a standard media app. When audio is playing, controls will appear on your lock screen and in the notification shade. This allows you to:

-   Play and pause audio while your device is locked.
-   Continue listening to notes while the Obsidian app is in the background.

This feature makes it possible to listen to your notes while you are on the go.
